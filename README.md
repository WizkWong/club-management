# club-management

This project is my school group assignment, 5 person per group, so we create a website server that can handle the club work.

We only focused on how the webiste can offer to the client, so security is big flaw and not good at handling big data.

It has three type of user: admin, member, and non-registered member(user)

Admin feature:
Can create and modify event
Can set attendance and modify it
Modify member account
View, accept, reject or delete the user request
Generate, view or download a report
Edit the page (only home and about page)

Member feature
Can create or delete request
Modify their profile
View event
View or submit task
Take attendance

Non-registered member(user) feature:
Can view home page, about page and event page with list of event
Can register account

Additional:
attendance code will be genrated when attendance is set, and will expired after the amount of time had passed.

Facts of this project during development:
Honestly, I(WizkWong) do 90 percent of the work and manage to complete it in time. If you don't trust me, you can see the commit history. The rest 10 percent only my other two member, but I guide them to do, so my idea is there.
I guess I am the project manager, full-stack developer, and Software Test Engineer.
