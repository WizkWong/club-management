# club-management

This project is my school group assignment, 5 person per group, so we create a website server that can handle the club work.

We only focused on how the webiste can offer to the client, so security is big flaw and not good at handling big data.

It has three type of user: admin, member, and non-registered member(user)

- Admin feature: <br>
  - Can create and modify event <br>
  - Can set attendance and modify it <br>
  - Modify member account <br>
  - View, accept, reject or delete the user request <br>
  - Generate, view or download a report <br>
  - Edit the page (only home and about page)

- Member feature <br>
  - Can create or delete request <br>
  - Modify their profile <br>
  - View event <br>
  - View or submit task <br>
  - Take attendance <br>

- Non-registered member(user) feature: <br>
  - Can view home page, about page and event page with list of event <br>
  - Can register account

- Additional: <br>
  - Attendance code will be genrated when attendance is set, and will expired after the amount of time had passed. <br>

- Facts of this project during development: <br>
  - Honestly, I(WizkWong) do 90 percent of the work and manage to complete it in time. If you don't trust me, you can see the commit history. The rest 10 percent only my other two member, but I guide them to do, so my idea is there. <br>
  - I guess I am the Project Manager, Full-Stack Developer, and Software Test Engineer.
